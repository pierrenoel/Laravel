# Introduction

Laravel is a web application developement framework for PHP. It makes the task of building a database-backend PHP
much easier than if you simply started from scratch.

Like many frameworks, Laravel provides a way of organizing and designing an application's souce code. If we take a look
at this own organisation, we see that Laravel uses the "Model View Controller" (MVC). 

## Explanation

- Model, which defines the data structure and communicate with the database
- View, which handles the interface between the application and the users
- Controller, which manages data flow and communicate between the Model and the View

All these features make building an app in Laravel much faster than building from scratch. This makes Laravel a popular tool for rapid PHP development.
