# Your first API

In this section, we are going to create our first API using Laravel. 

## Install Postman

> Postman is currently one of the most popular tools used in API testing. It started in 2012 as a side project by Abhinav Asthana to simplify API workflow in testing and development. API stands for Application Programming Interface which allows software applications to communicate with each other via API calls.

## Create your API 

``` terminal
cd ~ 
cd Desktop
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel API
```

### 1. Configure your database

```terminal
    mysql -u username -p
    create database tasks;
```
