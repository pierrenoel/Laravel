## The most important folder to keep in mind

* Models are in the folder **app**
* Controllers are in the folder **app/Http/Controllers**
* Views are in the folder **resources/views**
* Migrations are in the folder **database/migrations**

Remain that to add some style and some javascript, you need to place them in the **resources** folder!
