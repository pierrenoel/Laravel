# Exercice learningLaravel

Before we continue on this pratice, we have learned three Artisan commands:
- `php artisan make:controller ArticleController --resouce`
- `php artisan make:model Article`
- `php artisan make:migration create_articles_table`

Well, I have a surprise for you! We can initiate the three one in one command:

`php artisan make:model Article -mcr`

- **'-mcr'** means *migration*,*controller*,*resource*
  
## Add some style to our views
